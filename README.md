## About

Click-to-call enables your company to convert web traffic into phone calls with

## Set up

### Requirements

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) **2.6.x** version
- [Sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/)

### Twilio Account Settings

This application should give you a ready-made starting point for writing your own application.
Before we begin, we need to collect all the config values we need to run the application:

| Config Value | Description |
| :----------  | :---------- |
| TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID and TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN | You could find them on Twilio console [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/account/settings) |
| API_HOST | The one generated by [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) |
| TWILIO_NUMBER | You could get one on Twilio console [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming) |

### Local Development

1. First clone this repository and `cd` into it.

   ```bash
   git clone git://github.com/TwilioDevEd/clicktocall-rails.git
   cd clicktocall-rails
   ```

2. Install the dependencies.

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

3. Set your environment variables.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   See [Twilio Account Settings](#twilio-account-settings) to locate the necessary environment variables. The phone number should be in [E.164 format](https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/phone-numbers/how-do-i-format-phone-numbers-to-work-internationally).

4. Start the development server (will run on port 3000).

   ```bash
   make serve
   ```

5. Expose your application to the wider internet using ngrok. You can click [here](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/09/6-awesome-reasons-to-use-ngrok-when-testing-webhooks.html) for more details. This step **is important** because the application won't work as expected if you run it through localhost.

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

6. Once ngrok is running, open up your browser and go to your ngrok URL. It will look like this: `http://<ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io`
Then, enter a number in the box provided and click "Contact Sales" to initiate a call.

That's it!

### Docker

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) already installed on your machine, you can use our `docker-compose.yml` to setup your project.

1. Make sure you have the project cloned.
2. Setup the `.env` file as outlined in the [Local Development](#local-development) steps.
3. Run `docker-compose up`.
4. Follow the steps in [Local Development](#local-development) on how to expose your port to Twilio using a tool like ngrok and configure the remaining parts of your application.

### Tests

You can run the tests locally by runnung:

```bash
bundle exec rails test
```

### Cloud deployment

Additionally to trying out this application locally, you can deploy it to a variety of host services. Here is a small selection of them.

Please be aware that some of these might charge you for the usage or might make the source code for this application visible to the public. When in doubt research the respective hosting service first.
