## Set up

### Requirements

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) **2.6.x** version
- [Sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) **10.x** or **12.x** version

### Twilio Account Settings

This application should give you a ready-made starting point for writing your own application.
Before we begin, we need to collect all the config values we need to run the application:

| Config Value | Description |
| :----------  | :---------- |
| TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID and TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN | You could find them on Twilio console [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/account/settings) |
| API_HOST | The one generated by [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) |
| TWILIO_NUMBER | You could get one on Twilio console [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming) |

### Local Development

1. First clone this repository and `cd` into it.

   ```bash
   git clone git://github.com/TwilioDevEd/clicktocall-rails.git
   cd clicktocall-rails
   ```

2. Install the dependencies.

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

3. Set your environment variables.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   See [Twilio Account Settings](#twilio-account-settings) to locate the necessary environment variables. The phone number should be in [E.164 format](https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/phone-numbers/how-do-i-format-phone-numbers-to-work-internationally).

4. Setup server
   ```bash
   make serve-setup
   ```

5. Start the development server (will run on port 3000).

   ```bash
   make serve
   ```

6. Expose your application to the wider internet using ngrok. You can click [here](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/09/6-awesome-reasons-to-use-ngrok-when-testing-webhooks.html) for more details. This step **is important** because the application won't work as expected if you run it through localhost.

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

7. Once ngrok is running, open up your browser and go to your ngrok URL. It will look like this: `http://<ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io`
Then, enter a number in the box provided and click "Contact Sales" to initiate a call.

That's it!

### Tests

You can run the tests locally by runnung:

```bash
bundle exec rails test
```
